# Test Lab
In this repo, I plan to include several network level attack prototype that are intended to disrupt data flow. This is experimental and research effort and the code here must be used with care and not in any malicious intent. The goal of the experiment is to emulate a hostile network environment that is typically observed in countries with censorship (China, Iran , etc)

## TCP RESET Attack

This type of attack is well observed in China and Iran and is typically deployed to disrupt flow of traffic.
