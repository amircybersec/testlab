# Test Lab
In this repo, I plan to include several network level attack prototypes that are intended to disrupt data flow. This is experimental research effort and the code here must be used with care and not in any malicious intent. The goal of the experiment is to emulate a hostile network environment that is typically observed in countries with censorship (China, Iran , etc) for testing and measuring resiliency of solutions against such attacks.

## TCP RESET Attack

This type of attack is well observed in China and Iran and is deployed to disrupt flow of traffic. In this attack model, a third device on the network that can sniff the traffic between the client & server, forge a new TCP packet with RESET flag, and send it as a fake response coming (from the destination/server) to end the connection. This tactic is used by firewalls to initially allow the traffic to go through, analyze its content, and block it if certain condistions are met. This method also has less colateral damage since blocking destination IP addresses or ports may block access to other services. 

These two documents [1](https://robertheaton.com/2020/04/27/how-does-a-tcp-reset-attack-work/),[2](https://squidarth.com/article/networking/2020/05/03/tcp-resets.html) provide great insights and details, and I highly recommend reading them if you want to get the full picture. In those documents, a fully local test (attacker, client, server on the same computer) is done using loopback adaptor and netcat (nc) to do the dial function. 

### Setting up your lab

I suggest trying to repeat tests and reporduce the results in the experiments in the above documents on your computer. I also suggest going one step further and run your client and server on different machines (either on the same local netwokr or removely in a VPS). Please note to properly configure your firewall rules on your VPS provider, operating system (e.g. `ufw` on Ubuntu). If you run your server on home network and client connects from outside, you also need to setup port forwarding on your router for the listenging port.  

### First experiment

The first experiment is designed to disrupt attempts to perform domain name resolution over TCP (TCP RESET attack only applied to TCP connections). The following command performs a name resolution using the resolver 8.8.8.8. DNS resolution is usually done over UDP but the datagram packets can be carried with TCP payload. The advantage of this test is that you don't need to setup a listening server, which makes the setup a bit easier. 

```
dig @8.8.8.8 google.com +tcp
```

We setup the experiment such that the attacker (`/reset_attack/main.py`): 

  1. Sniffs the traffic on the device interface (e.g. `eth01`)
  2. When a packet is sent to 8.8.8.8, it will craft a new packet (pretending to be from 8.8.8.8) destined to `dig` client 
  3. It will inject the crafted packet into the network interface

The following wireshark capture shows the DNS resolution over TCP before injecting reset packets:

Next, we are going to repeat DNS resolution over TCP and this time, we are going to inject a reset packget.

To reporduce the results, run the python scapy script on your local machine and make sure you set the following parameters correctly in the script

 - the client IP (your interface IP),
 - server IP (8.8.8.8)
 - the server port (53)

Make sure run the script with superuser previlege:

```
sudo PYTHONPATH=$HOME/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/ python main.py
```

In the above case, the scapy package is installed at `$HOME/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/`. 

If the above script is running, running dig will through "connection reset" error as shown below. Please note that dig retries a few times and aborts after several tries.

```
> dig @8.8.8.8 google.com +tcp
;; Connection to 8.8.8.8#53(8.8.8.8) for google.com failed: timed out.
;; communications error to 8.8.8.8#53: connection reset
;; Connection to 8.8.8.8#53(8.8.8.8) for google.com failed: timed out.
```

### Timing challenges

Once of the most challenging aspect of performing TCP Reset attack is making sure the forged TCP packet arrives at the client before server actual response (ACK) has arrived. This is due to the design of TCP to strictly enforce sequence number of packets with RESET flag. Initially in my tests, all of the reset packets were arriving too late, after the connection was finalized and terminated. It turned out that the server responses were beating me to the punch and arriving sooner. The picture below shows reset packets (shown by red lines) all arrive after the communication is terminated.

There are a few observatons here. When I ran the above test, my laptop was on WiFi, and the WiFi access point was connected to Internet with Fiber optics which is known to have very low latency. In otherwords, the connected between client and server (my laptop and google server) was after than my python script. Basically, the sniff, analyze, craft packet and inject operations were in total slower than server response time. 

To work around this, I decided to slowdown my Internet connection and increase latency. I guess there are more precise ways to slowdown a Internet link but my first hunch was to use my celluar data since it is really bad, specially in my room. (I had never been excited by the prospects of a sh*ty service). It turns out that the slow internet connection in this case, can give the attacker an timing edge. The image below the repeat of the same test but this time data traveling through cellular network to Google DNS.

The `dig` client retries a few times and gives up finally. 

```
> dig @8.8.8.8 google.com +tcp
;; Connection to 8.8.8.8#53(8.8.8.8) for google.com failed: timed out.
;; communications error to 8.8.8.8#53: connection reset
;; Connection to 8.8.8.8#53(8.8.8.8) for google.com failed: timed out.
```

It seems like the relative position of the attacker to the victim (client) -- measured in number of hops -- can play a factor in this race. Also, it must be noted that we are sniffing the whole traffic, filtering, processing it in scapy (python) which is not optimized for speed. An attacker with an optimized software stack (written in Go or C), with a faster hardware (real time hardware?) can obtain an advantage. When infrastructures engage in this type of disruptions, they sometime trottle the traffic to allow them to perform DPI (deep packet inspection) on many streams. 

### Second experiment

One of the motivations for this work was to layout a test bed for one of the projects I am working on. I am in the process of building a report collector system that clients can use to report incidents (network error log). This can be a great way to observe disruptions from client/source vantage point and report them to the service provider through a different route / mechanism. The report collectors can be distributed and more resilient than the client. 

One of the real applications of this type of report collection is using them in VPN/tunnel clients that are often used for censorship circumvension. I hope the result of this work gets included in several client applications with large install base.

Okay, back to the point. Once of the applications I am looking at is Outline by Jigsaw which is a very popular distributed VPN system. Outline recently released a [new SDK](https://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-sdk) that you can use to add several bells and whistle to your application's networking to increase resilience to censorship. There is a connectivity tester script on the SDK that basically performs the same `dig` operation if configured with the following flags:

```
go run github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-sdk/x/examples/outline-connectivity@latest -v -transport="split:1" -proto tcp -resolver 8.8.8.8 -domain google.com
```

For a one-to-one comparison you can can both and do a wireshark / or tcpdump capture and see for yourself. The flag `-transport` defines a higher level data presentation / abstraction. For example, `split:2` will break the TCP payload in two and translates one TCP connection to two TCP connections with two payloads, each carrying half of the payload. `split:1` basically provides a one-to-one mapping of input packet to the output packet (divided by one). 


### Third experiment

Outline can also use a shadowsocks transport to encypt and pass it to shadowsocks server. For this experiment, I setup a server on a VPS (datacenter) and installed the Outline server on it. I then ran the connectivity tester with `-transport` being set as shown below: 

```
KEY=ss://examplekey_V0Zi1wb2x5MTMwNTpLeTUyN2duU3FEVFB3R0JpQ1RxUnlT@104.x.x.x:65496/
PREFIX=POST%20
go run github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-sdk/x/examples/outline-connectivity@latest -v -transport="$KEY?prefix=$PREFIX" -proto tcp -resolver 8.8.8.8 && echo Prefix "$PREFIX" works!
```

The above command basically performs the following:

Client ----encytpted DNS Resolution packet----> Server -----decypted packet ----> 8.8.8.8

Please note that shadowsocks is end-to-end encypyted and the payload for DNS inquiry is encrypted and sent to the server. The server then decrypts and send the packet to the specified resolver and relays back the encrypted response. 

The connectivility tester successfully catches the TCP RESET error and logs it. 
```
[DEBUG] 2023/10/01 22:21:38.004242 main.go:135: Test error: read: failed to read salt: read tcp 192.x.x.x:33422->104.x.x.x:65496: read: connection reset by peer

exit status 1
```
Please note that you must update the sever IP and port in the `reset_attack/main.py' script to match your Outline server and listenging port.

The next step is to setup a report collector sever and send the JSON report to it. I am planning to expand client support for logging for metrics. The report collector can collect, analyze, and/or visualize these data.
