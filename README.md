# Test Lab
In this repo, I plan to include several network level attack prototypes that are intended to disrupt data flow. This is experimental and research effort and the code here must be used with care and not in any malicious intent. The goal of the experiment is to emulate a hostile network environment that is typically observed in countries with censorship (China, Iran , etc) for testing and measuring resiliency of solutions against such attacks.

## TCP RESET Attack

This type of attack is well observed in China and Iran and is deployed to disrupt flow of traffic. In this attack model, a third device on the network that can sniff the traffic between the client & server, can forge a new TCP packet with RESET flag and send it as a fake response coming from the server to end the connection. This tactic is used by firewalls mainly to first allow the traffic to go through, analyze its content, and block if certain condistions are met. This method also has less colateral damage since blocking destination IP addresses altogether may block access to other services. 

These two documents [1](https://robertheaton.com/2020/04/27/how-does-a-tcp-reset-attack-work/),[2](https://squidarth.com/article/networking/2020/05/03/tcp-resets.html) provide great insights and details, that I highly recommend reading them if you want to get the full picture. In those documents, a fully local test is done using loopback adaptor and netcat (nc) to do the dial function. 

### First experiment

The first experiment is designed to disrupt attempts to perform domain name resolution over TCP (TCP RESET attack only applied to TCP connections). The following command performs a name resolution using the resolver 8.8.8.8. 
```
dig @8.8.8.8 google.com +tcp
```

We setup the experiment such that the attacker (`/reset_attack/main.py`): 

  1. Sniffs the traffic on the device interface
  2. When a packet is sent to 8.8.8.8, it will craft a new packet (pretending to be from 8.8.8.8) destined to dig client 
  3. It will inject the traffic into the network interface

The following wireshark capture shows the DNS resolution over TCP before injecting reset packets:

To reporduce the results, run the python scapy script on your local machine and make sure you set the client IP (your interface IP), server IP (8.8.8.8) and the server port (53) correctly in the script. Then run the script with superuser previlege:

```
sudo PYTHONPATH=$HOME/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/ python main.py`
```
In the above case, the scapy package is installed at `$HOME/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/`. 

If the above script is running, running dig will through "connection reset" error as shown below. Please note that dig retries a few times and aborts after several tries.

```
> dig @8.8.8.8 google.com +tcp
;; Connection to 8.8.8.8#53(8.8.8.8) for google.com failed: timed out.
;; communications error to 8.8.8.8#53: connection reset
;; Connection to 8.8.8.8#53(8.8.8.8) for google.com failed: timed out.
```

### Timing challenges

Once of the most challenging aspect of performing TCP Reset attack is making sure the forged TCP packet arrives at the client before server actual response (ACK) has arrived. This is due to a secuirty

Looking under the hood:

An slow connection between client and server and a faster connection between client and the attacker can give the attacker an edge in this attack.

```
go run github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-sdk/x/examples/outline-connectivity@latest -v -transport="split:1" -proto tcp -resolver 8.8.8.8
```

### Second experiment
```
KEY=ss://examplekey_V0Zi1wb2x5MTMwNTpLeTUyN2duU3FEVFB3R0JpQ1RxUnlT@104.x.x.x:65496/
PREFIX=POST%20
go run github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-sdk/x/examples/outline-connectivity@latest -v -transport="$KEY?prefix=$PREFIX" -proto tcp -resolver 8.8.8.8 && echo Prefix "$PREFIX" works!
```

### Attack successful
```
[DEBUG] 2023/10/01 22:21:38.004242 main.go:135: Test error: read: failed to read salt: read tcp 192.x.x.x:33422->104.x.x.x:65496: read: connection reset by peer
{"resolver":"8.8.8.8:53","proto":"tcp","time":"2023-10-02T05:21:37Z","duration_ms":112,"error":{"op":"read","posix_error":"ECONNRESET","msg":"connection reset by peer"}}
exit status 1
```

### Timing challenges:

Reset packages arriving too late after the connection is closed with FIN flag or the SEQ number has already increased.
